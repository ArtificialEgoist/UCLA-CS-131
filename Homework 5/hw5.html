<h1>Homework 5: Calculators and Dictionaries Revisited</h1>

<h2>Due Thursday, May 16 at 11:30pm</h2>
<h3>Turn in your homework via the course web page as an updated version of the <tt>hw5.java</tt>
text file that I have provided.</h3> 

<h3>Make sure the file can be successfully compiled with <tt>javac</tt>.  There should be <i>no compilation errors or warnings</i>;
if not you get an automatic 0 for the homework!</h3>

<h3>Recall the CS131 Academic Honesty Policy!  You must list whom you
discussed the assignment with at the top of your assignment, and also what
other resources you used.</h3>

<p>For this assignment we will revisit the calculator and dictionaries we saw on Homework 2, in order to
concretely compare the functional style we saw in OCaml with the object-oriented style of Java.
As usual, good style
matters.  <b>Here are the rules:</b>
 <ul>
   <li><b>Do not modify the names of any types, classes, instance variables, and methods that we have provided in <tt>hw5.java</tt>.  We are relying on them for testing purposes; your code will get no credit in cases where the test script can't find what it's looking for.</b>
 <li>Use interfaces as types
and classes as their implementations, rarely if ever using a class
directly as a type.</li>
 <li><i>Never</i> use type-unsafe features
of Java, like casts and the <tt>instanceof</tt> expression.  If you need
   to ever figure out the class of some object, then your design is not as
   object-oriented as it should be.</li>
<li>Always compare objects with their <tt>equals</tt> method rather than with the <tt>==</tt> operator.
<li>You may use any number of helper methods that you require.  Make those
  <tt>protected</tt> or <tt>private</tt> as you see fit.
</ul>

A few other tips: <ul>
  <li>You will find the <a href="http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api">Java API Documentation</a> useful to
  understand how various data structures from the standard library work.
<li>Since we are now in an imperative language, you can make use of side effects (e.g., updating a variable's value).  Feel free to do this when it feels natural to you, as long as your code works as intended.
</li>
<li> Write comments where useful to tell the
reader what's going on.</li>

<li> Test your functions on several inputs, including corner cases --
we will be doing the same.</li>
</ul>

Now on to the assignment!


<h3>Problem #1: Calculators</h3>

<ol type="a">
<p> <li> Recall the OCaml type <tt>aexp</tt> of calculator expressions from Homework 2:

<p><tt>type op = Plus | Minus | Times | Divide</tt><br>
<tt>type aexp = Num of float | BinOp of aexp * op * aexp</tt>

<p> File <tt>hw5.java</tt> declares an interface <tt>AExp</tt> as the
  Java version of this type.  Uncomment the <tt>eval</tt> function in
  <tt>AExp</tt> and define two classes <tt>Num</tt> and <tt>BinOp</tt>
  that implement <tt>AExp</tt>.  The <tt>eval</tt> method should
  behave just like the <tt>evalAExp</tt> function from Homework 2,
  except here we're using <tt>double</tt>s instead of <tt>float</tt>s.
  I've defined an <i>enum</i>, which in Java is essentially a class
  with a finite number of instances (in this case, named
  <tt>PLUS</tt>, <tt>MINUS</tt>, etc.), to represent the <tt>op</tt>
  type.  I've also provided <tt>calculate</tt> methods for these
  objects, which you should find useful.

  <p>Uncomment the first test case in
  <tt>CalcTest.main</tt> for an example of what you should support,
  and add more test cases to gain confidence in your code.</li>

<p><li> In Homework 2 we also saw the OCaml type <tt>sopn</tt> of stack operations:

<p><tt>type sopn = Push of float | Swap | Calculate of op</tt>

<p>This type is represented by the <tt>Sopn</tt> interface in
<tt>hw5.java</tt>.  The class <tt>RPNExp</tt> represents a list of
<tt>Sopn</tt> instructions.  Uncomment its <tt>eval</tt> method and
implement it; the method should behave like <tt>evalRPN</tt> from Homework 2.
  Implementing the method will require you to declare three classes
that implement the <tt>Sopn</tt> interface.  Feel free to add whatever methods seem useful to the
  <tt>Sopn</tt> interface.
  See the second test case in <tt>CalcTest</tt> for an example of what your code should do.
  <i>If implemented properly, you will not need to use <tt>instanceof</tt> tests or casts.</i>
  You will find the Java <tt>List</tt> type and its implementations as well as the Java <tt>Stack</tt>
  class useful.

  <p>Aside from ordinary <tt>for</tt> and <tt>while</tt> loops, Java has a special "for-each" loop for iterating over arrays and other collections.  Check out <a href="http://docs.oracle.com/javase/1.5.0/docs/guide/language/foreach.html">this page</a> for an example with lists.  Use this loop instead of a regular <tt>for</tt> or <tt>while</tt> loop whenever possible.
  </li>

<p>
<li>Uncomment the method <tt>toRPN</tt> in <tt>AExp</tt> and implement it; the method should have the same behavior
  as <tt>toRPN</tt> in Homework 2.  Uncomment the third test case in <tt>CalcTest</tt>.  You may find it useful to define a <tt>toString()</tt> method in each class implementing <tt>AExp</tt> for testing purposes.  For instance, a reasonable output of the given test case is <tt>[Push 1.0, Push 2.0, Calculate PLUS, Push 3.0, Calculate TIMES]</tt>.  (In Java, the <tt>+</tt> operator for string concatenation is highly overloaded, and in particular an invocation
  <tt>"hi" + o</tt> for any object <tt>o</tt> is equivalent to <tt>"hi" + o.toString()</tt>.  Java lists already have a well-defined <tt>toString()</tt> method that recursively convert each element to a string.)
</li>


<p><li>The same expression can be computed several ways in the
	    stack machine, because for each subexpression, you can
	    choose to evaluate the left side first or the right side
	    first.  (Because subtraction and division are not commutative,
	    evaluating the right side first and then the left will require a
	    <tt>Swap</tt> to fix things up.)

	    <p>For example, 1.0 - (2.0 + 3.0) can be represented (using OCaml syntax for simplicity) either by 

	      <p><tt>[Push 1.0; Push 2.0; Push 3.0; Calculate Plus; Calculate Minus]</tt>

		<p> or by

   <p><tt>[Push 2.0; Push 3.0; Calculate Plus; Push 1.0; Swap; Calculate Minus]</tt>

     <p>The first list of commands requires a stack that can hold at least
       three numbers at once, whereas the second list never requires more than
       two numbers on the stack at any one time.

       <p>Uncomment the method <tt>toRPNopt</tt> in <tt>AExp</tt> and implement it.
          The function returns a pair containing (1) an optimal sequence of commands
	 to evaluate the given arithmetic expression; and (2) the maximum
	 size of the stack necessary for evaluating this sequence of commands.
	 Optimal here means requiring the smallest possible <i>maximum</i>
	 number of values on the stack at once during evaluation.  I've provided a generic <tt>Pair</tt> class
         for your use, since unlike in OCaml, tuples are not built in to Java.

	 <p><tt>toRPNopt</tt> can be computed recursively, using the
	   optimal command sequences for the two operands and the
	   stack sizes they each require.  You can decide which side
	   (left or right) to evaluate first just by looking at the
	   stack sizes each requires, without looking at their
	   particular command sequences.  By default you should evaluate the left operand first,
           as with <tt>toRPN</tt>.  However, you should instead evaluate the right
	   operand first if it will reduce the maximum stack size required.
           Also, in that case don't forget to insert a
	   <tt>Swap</tt> command if the operation being computed is non-commutative.
           Uncomment the fourth test case in <tt>CalcTest</tt> for an example.</li> </ol>

<h3>Problem #2: Dictionaries</h3>

The interface <tt>Dict</tt> in <tt>hw5.java</tt> represents the type of a dictionary, parameterized by the types for
keys and values.  Note that the dictionary is updated in place, as is typical for Java:  the <tt>put</tt>
method has a <tt>void</tt> return type and simply mutates the data structure rather than returning a new one.  The <tt>get</tt> method should throw the declared <tt>NotFoundException</tt> if the given key is not in the dictionary.

<ol type="a">
<li> Recall our OCaml type <tt>dict2</tt> from Homework 2, which implements dictionaries as a linked list of entries:

<blockquote>
  <p><tt>type dict2 = Empty | Entry of string * int * dict2
 </tt></p>
</blockquote>

The class <tt>DictImpl2</tt> in <tt>hw5.java</tt> is the analogous
implementation for Java (but generalized to be polymorphic over the types of keys and values).
  It contains a field of type <tt>Node</tt>
which represents the root of a linked list of entries.  Right now
<tt>DictImpl2</tt>'s constructor and methods are broken; you need to
fix them.  This will also involve adding methods to <tt>Node</tt> and to the two classes <tt>Empty</tt>
and <tt>Entry</tt> that implement <tt>Node</tt>, for putting and getting things. 
  <i>If implemented properly, you will not need to use <tt>instanceof</tt> tests or casts.  For example, the
    <tt>DictImpl2</tt> should never need to know whether its <tt>root</tt> is empty or not.</i>
  Uncomment the first test case in <tt>DictTest</tt> for an example usage.

<p><li> Recall <tt>dict3</tt> from Homework 2, in which we represented a dictionary as a function from keys to values.
The class <tt>DictImpl3</tt> in <tt>hw5.java</tt> is the analogous
implementation for Java (again generalized to be polymorphic).  Java doesn't have first-class functions (though they are coming in the next version of Java!) but they can be simulated
  using objects.  Accordingly, <tt>DictImpl3</tt> contains a field of type <tt>DictFun<K,V></tt>,
which represents an arbitrary function with argument type <tt>K</tt> and result type <tt>V</tt>.
  The intent is that this function will return the value
  associated with a given key in the dictionary, and it will throw the <tt>NotFoundException</tt> if the key
  is not in the dictionary (this behavior is different than what we did in OCaml, where we used the <tt>option</tt>
  type instead of throwing an exception).

<p>  Right now
<tt>DictImpl3</tt>'s constructor and methods are broken; you need to
fix them.  You may find Java's syntax for <a href="http://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/java/javaOO/anonymousclasses.html">anonymous classes</a> useful.
Uncomment the second test case in <tt>DictTest</tt> for an example usage.
