<h1>Homework 4: An Interpreter for Mini-OCaml (MOCaml)</h1>

<h2>
Due Thursday, May 2, at 11:30pm</h2>
<h3>Turn in your homework via the course web page as an updated version of the
<tt>interp.ml</tt> text file that I have provided in the attached zip archive; do not rename the file.

<h3>Make sure your code can be successfully loaded into the OCaml interpreter;
if not you get an automatic 0 for the homework!</h3>

<h3>Recall the CS131 Academic Honesty Policy!  You must say whom you
discussed the assignment with at the top of your assignment, and also what
other resources you used.</h3>

<h3>IMPORTANT: The interpreter code loads properly on Mac OS X and Linux, but I have not tested it on
a Windows machine.  If you encounter a problem, please use the SEASNet Linux machines instead.</h3>

For this
assignment, you will implement an interpreter (both an evaluator and a
static typechecker) for a subset of OCaml in OCaml.  This is a fun way
to get more practice with OCaml and also to really learn how the
various language constructs behave.  You should obey our usual style
rules and tips from past homeworks, of course (e.g., no use of any imperative features of OCaml).

<p>Now on to the assignment!  First <tt>unzip</tt> the <tt>hw4</tt>
directory from the zip archive I've provided.  The directory
contains an incomplete interpreter for a subset of OCaml, which we'll
call Mini-OCaml, or MOCaml.  The interpreter is structured similar to the one we did in class.
Your job is to complete the interpreter by implementing the two functions <tt>eval</tt> and <tt>typecheck</tt>
in the file <tt>interp.ml</tt>.  Along the way you will likely find it useful to define a few helper functions
in that file as well.

Your MOCaml interpreter should behave <i>exactly</i> like the regular
<tt>ocaml</tt> interpreter for the subset of OCaml that we are
handling.  So if you ever want to figure out what should happen when a particular expression is typechecked
and/or evaluated,
just try it in <tt>ocaml</tt> and find out!  There are only a few small differences between the <tt>ocaml</tt> interpreter and the one you are building:

<ul>
  <li>Your typechecker does not have to signal warnings where <tt>ocaml</tt> would do so, e.g. for pattern matching that is not exhaustive.</li>
  <li>Your typechecker can assume, rather than needing to check, that a pattern refers to any particular variable name at most once.</li>
  <li>The error messages displayed by your typechecker and evaluator will be different than in OCaml.
  <li>You can exit your interpreter by typing a single semi-colon followed by a return.</li>
</ul>


<p>Here is a description of the various files I've provided and
what you must do.  <b>Read the rest of this document carefully and completely before getting started!</b>

<ul>

<li><tt>lexer.ml</tt> and <tt>parser.ml</tt>: The first step in an interpreter is to <i>parse</i>
  a given program, and I have done this for you.  The parser checks for syntactic correctness and
  produces an <i>abstract syntax tree</i> that unambiguously represents the program.  These two files contain a parser for MOCaml; the files were 
automatically generated from a high-level
  description of the MOCaml grammar that I wrote using the
    <tt>ocamllex</tt> and <tt>ocamlyacc</tt> parser generator tools.  <i>You do not need to look at
  these files.</i></li><p>
  
  <li><tt>ast.ml</tt>:  This file defines the abstract syntax tree representation for MOCaml programs via  a collection of datatypes.
  A MOCaml program is a single expression, which is also a legal OCaml expression, and its abstract syntax tree is represented as a value of type <tt>moexpr</tt>.  A few notes about the syntax of MOCaml:
  <ul>
    <li>
   Top-level declarations such as <tt>let x = 3;;</tt> are not supported in MOCaml; a MOCaml program is just a single expression.</li>
   <li>To avoid the need for type inference, all variable declarations must include an explicit type annotation.
       The wildcard pattern similarly must include an explicit type annotation.</li></ul>
  <i>Read this file to familiarize yourself with our representation of MOCaml programs, which
    you will need to manipulate in your code.</i></li><p>
  
  <li><tt>env.ml</tt>: As we saw in class, both the evaluator and the
  typechecker use a notion of <i>environment</i>.  This file contains
  a module <tt>Env</tt> that defines a (polymorphic) type <tt>'a env</tt> for
  environments along with associated operations.  The type <tt>'a
  env</tt> maps strings (i.e., variable names) to values of type
  <tt>'a</tt>.  We will use this same environment type both for
  value environments (in the evaluator) and type environments (in the
  typechecker).  <i>Read the comments in the file as well as the
  "module type" definition, which gives the interface to the
  environment module, in order to familiarize yourself with the
  type for environments and the associated operations.</i> </li><p>

<li><tt>interp.ml</tt> declares the <tt>eval</tt> and <tt>typecheck</tt> functions that you need to implement, but
  they currently just raise an <tt>ImplementMe</tt> exception.  You will implement these functions in exactly the style we saw in class:

  <ol>
    <li> The <tt>eval</tt> function evaluates a given expression to a value, in the context of a given environment.
    Your function should signal a match failure exception (by raising the <tt>MatchFailure</tt> exception defined in <tt>interp.ml</tt>) whenever the OCaml interpreter would.
    Additionally, your interpreter should perform <i>dynamic typechecking</i> as we did in class, raising a <tt>DynamicTypeError</tt> exception whenever a type error is encountered.

    <p>Dynamic typechecking is redundant since you are also implementing a static typechecker (see below), and a program that passes the static typechecker will never raise a <tt>DynamicTypeError</tt> at run time if your static typechecker is properly implemented.  But it is useful to see concretely the difference between the two; for instance, the dynamic typechecker should only raise an error when the program gets "stuck" at run time because it's trying to invoke a primitive operation with arguments of the wrong type, while the static typechecker will conservatively reject some good programs.
    </li><p>
    <li>The <tt>typecheck</tt> function produces the type of a given expression, in the context of a given type environment.  Your function should signal a type error (by raising the <tt>TypeError</tt> exception defined in <tt>interp.ml</tt>) whenever the OCaml interpreter would signal a static type error. </li>
    </ol></li>

<p>    You may use any functions that you want from the OCaml standard
    library to implement your interpreter.  Some functions from the
    <tt>List</tt> module should come in handy for manipulating the
    various lists in our abstract syntax tree.  <p>

The <tt>eval</tt> and <tt>typecheck</tt> functions should be implemented in the same style we saw in class, but they must handle some more sophisticated parts of the OCaml language, specifically:
<ul>
  <li> Rather than just variables, MOCaml includes several different kinds of patterns.  You will therefore find it useful to have a helper function for <tt>eval</tt>
  that matches a value against a pattern.  A successful match should produce an environment, which maps the variables defined in the pattern to their values.  For example, the result of matching the value
  <tt>((1,2),(3,4))</tt> against the pattern <tt>(((x1:int),(y1:int)),((x2:int),(y2:int)))</tt> is the environment
  <tt>{(x1, 1),(y1, 2),(x2, 3),(y2, 4)}</tt>.  Similarly, you will find it useful to have a helper function for <tt>typecheck</tt> that typechecks a pattern, producing a type environment for the variables defined in the pattern, and also
  producing the overall type of the pattern.</li><p>

  <li>MOCaml includes (first-class) functions.  A key requirement is
  to properly implement OCaml's static scoping behavior.  For this
  purpose, notice that the representation <tt>FunctionVal</tt> of a
  function value in <tt>ast.ml</tt> includes an environment.  You should use this component to store the function's
  static (or <i>lexical</i>) environment, which can then be used whenever the function is invoked.</li><p>
</ul>

<li><tt>repl.ml</tt>:  This file contains code that implements the MOCaml <i>read-eval-print loop</i> or REPL, which continually reads an expression, parses it, typechecks it, evaluates it, and prints the result.
    The function <tt>mocaml()</tt> can be invoked to start
  the MOCaml interpreter.  <i>You
  do not need to look at this file.</i></li><p>

<li><tt>test.ml</tt>: Interpreters are complex and error-prone, so you will
want to test yours extensively -- we'll be doing the same as part of
grading.  To facilitate testing, I've provided a simple test harness in this file -- read the comments to see how to use this test
  harness.  The function <tt>testEval()</tt> will run all the tests for your evaluator, and the function <tt>testTypecheck()</tt> will run
  all the tests for your typechecker.  The list <tt>evalTests</tt> currently has a <i>very</i> small
  number of simple tests for your evaluator, and similarly for the list <tt>typecheckTests</tt> to test your typechecker.  You should add
  a lot more tests, for common cases, corner cases, error cases, etc.  I encourage you to share your tests with others
  (e.g., on Piazza), to have
  everyone collaborate to build a comprehensive test suite.  You may also find it useful to define a bunch of tests before starting
  your implementation, to act as a kind of "spec" for what your code should do.</li><p>
  
  <li><tt>hw4.ml</tt>: This file simply loads all
of the other files in order of dependencies.  Therefore, to load your
MOCaml interpreter, type the directive <tt>#use hw4.ml;;</tt> in the
OCaml interpreter.  Now type <tt>mocaml();;</tt> to fire up your interpreter or <tt>testEval();;</tt> and <tt>testTypecheck();;</tt> to run
  your test suite on your code. <i>You do not need to understand
the code in this file.</i></li><p>

</ul>
