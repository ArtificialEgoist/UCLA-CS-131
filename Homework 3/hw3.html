<h1>Homework 3: Random Art</h1>

<h2>Due Tuesday, April 23, at 11:30pm</h2>

<h3>Make sure your code can be successfully loaded into the OCaml interpreter;
if not you get an automatic 0 for the homework!</h3>

<h3>Recall the CS131 Academic Honesty Policy!  You must say whom you
discussed the assignment with at the top of your assignment, and also what
other resources you used.</h3>

You should obey our usual style rules and tips from past homeworks, of course.

<p>This homework brings together a number of topics we have studied,
including user-defined types, higher-order functions, and the OCaml module system.
(A good reference for the OCaml module system is <a href="http://caml.inria.fr/pub/docs/manual-ocaml-4.00/manual004.html">here</a>.)

<p>Your job is to write an ML
program to construct interesting images like the following
two examples.  <p>

<img src="http://www.cs.ucla.edu/~todd/tmp/sample.jpg">
<img src="http://www.cs.ucla.edu/~todd/tmp/sample2.jpg">

<p> First use the <tt>unzip</tt> program to extract the <tt>hw3</tt>
directory from the zip archive I've provided (on many platforms,
double-clicking on the archive also works).  To create pictures like
those above, you will complete the implementation of the module <tt>Expr1</tt> in <tt>expr1.ml</tt>.  That module declares
a type <tt>t</tt>, which represents expressions that produce a pixel value for a given x-y coordinate.
By randomly constructing expressions of
type <tt>Expr1.t</tt>, we will in effect be creating random functions to
apply to a grid of pixels, which will result in interesting artwork.

<p>Look at the definition of type <tt>t</tt> in <tt>expr1.ml</tt>.  A value of type <tt>Expr1.t</tt> represents a mathematical expression
over the two variables <tt>x</tt> and <tt>y</tt>.  The value
<tt>X</tt> represents the expression <tt>x</tt>, and similarly
for <tt>Y</tt>.  The expression <tt>Sin e</tt> represents the expression
<tt>sin(&pi; e)</tt>, and similarly the expression <tt>Cos e</tt> represents the expression
<tt>cos(&pi; e)</tt>.
The expression <tt>Avg(e1, e2)</tt> represents the expression that takes the
arithmetic mean of the two argument expressions' values;
<tt>Mult(e1, e2)</tt> represents the expression that takes the product
of the two argument expressions' values.
For example, the expression <tt>x * sin(&pi; y)</tt> would be represented by the expression <tt>Mult(X, Sin Y)</tt>.
The <tt>Expr1</tt>
module also includes functions for building each of these kinds of expressions as well as for printing an expression as a string.


<ol> <li><b>Expression Evaluation:</b>
  Complete the definition of the function <tt>eval</tt> in the module <tt>Expr1</tt>, 
  of type <tt>t -> float*float -> float</tt>, to
evaluate the given expression at the given (x,y) location.    The function currently just throws an <tt>ImplementMe</tt> exception, declared in <tt>hw3.ml</tt>.  You should
use the OCaml functions <tt>sin</tt> and <tt>cos</tt>, as well as the
floating-point value <tt>pi</tt> that I've defined in the module.
Recall that an expression tree like <tt>Sin(X)</tt> corresponds to
the mathematical expression <tt>sin(&pi; x)</tt>, and the
<tt>eval</tt> function must be defined appropriately.

  <p>Test this function on a few sample inputs before
moving on to the next part, including the <tt>sampleExpr</tt> value
  provided in <tt>Expr1</tt>. You can load all the relevant files into the OCaml interpreter by the directive <tt>#use hw3.ml</tt>.  Use this directive everywhere in the rest of the assignment as well to load your code for testing.  Here are a few sample runs (you may get
  different values for the low-order digits due to floating-point implementation differences between my machine and yours):<p>
<tt> # Expr1.eval
(Expr1.buildSin(Expr1.buildAvg(Expr1.buildX,Expr1.buildY))) (0.5,0.0);; <br>
- : float = 0.707106781186547462 <br> 
# Expr1.eval Expr1.sampleExpr (0.1,0.1);; <br> - : float = 0.569335014033423459
  </tt></li><p>

If you're getting sick of writing <tt>Expr1.</tt> before the name of
each function, you can type <tt> open Expr1;;</tt> in the ML interpreter to
make all of the names declared in <tt>Expr1</tt> available
at the top level.  So now you can just refer to <tt>eval</tt> directly, instead
of having to say <tt>Expr1.eval</tt>.  However, <i>be careful</i>:  If you modify
<tt>expr1.ml</tt> and reload it into the interpreter, you have
to <tt>open Expr1;;</tt> again.  Otherwise, you'll still be referring to the
<i>old</i> versions of things at the top level.  Of course, the new versions
will be available as <tt>Expr1.eval</tt>, etc.</li><p>

<li><b>Creating Images:</b> 
The file <tt>art.ml</tt> defines a module named <tt>Art</tt>, which
  provides the functionality for creating pictures.
  Take a look at the <tt>emitGrayscale</tt> and
<tt>emitColor</tt> 
functions, which generate grayscale and color bitmaps
respectively. These functions loop over all the coordinates in a
grid of a user-specified size, producing a pixel value for each one by invoking a given function
on the pixel's x-y coordinates.
In a language like C, we'd naturally use a <tt>for</tt> loop for this purpose.
Luckily, we can simulate <tt>for</tt>
loops with first-class functions!

<p>
In <tt>art.ml</tt>, complete the definition of the
function <tt>forLoop</tt> provided at the top of the file, of type <tt>int * int * (int -> unit) ->
unit</tt>.  (Depending on your implementation, it may have the more general type <tt>int * int * (int -> 'a) -> unit</tt>, which is also fine.)
The argument triple
contains a lower bound, an upper bound, and a function; your code
should apply the given function to all integers from the lower bound
to the upper bound, inclusive. In this way, the function is acting like the body of
the "loop".  If the upper bound is strictly less
than the lower bound, the call to <tt>forLoop</tt> should do nothing.
<b>Of course, you may not use any imperative features, such as OCaml loops or other things we did not discuss in class,
to implement this function.</b>

<p>Notice that the return type of the given function is <tt>unit</tt>.
  This indicates that the function is used only for its <i>side
  effects</i>.  In this case, the side effect will be writing pixel
  values to a file.  It may be useful to know about OCaml's expression
  of the form <tt>e1;e2</tt>, which executes <tt>e1</tt>, ignores its
  result, and then executes <tt>e2</tt>.  This kind of expression is
  <i>syntactic sugar</i> for the expression <tt>let _ = e1 in e2</tt>.
  (Note:  OCaml parses <tt>if e1 then e2 else e3;e4</tt> as <tt>(if e1 then e2 else e3);e4</tt>, so use explicit parentheses if you want something else.)  Also recall that <tt>()</tt> is the only value of type <tt>unit</tt>.

<p>Test your code with a call like
<tt>Art.forLoop(2, 5, (function x -> print_endline (string_of_int x)))</tt>,
which should print out the numbers 2, 3, 4, and 5.
Now produce a grayscale
picture of the expression <tt>sampleExpr</tt>. You can do this by the
invocation 
<tt>Art.emitGrayscale(Expr1.eval Expr1.sampleExpr, 150, "sample")</tt>.
Notice how currying is used to partially invoke your <tt>eval</tt>
function, in order to effectively turn
<tt>sampleExpr</tt> into a function.  This function is then applied to
each (x,y) coordinate (appropriately scaled to the range [-1,1] in
each dimension)
in a square of the specified size, and the resulting image file is named
"sample.pgm".  The image file should be in the current directory; on Windows if you don't find it, check
the directory C:/Documents and Settings/your-user-name.
<!-- If you get an uncaught exception <tt>Chr</tt> while producing an -->
<!-- image, -->
<!-- that is an indication that your <tt>eval</tt> function is returning a -->
<!-- number outside the range [-1,1], which should never happen on a correct -->
<!-- implementation. -->
</li><p>

<li> <b>Viewing Images</b>: Some image viewing applications can
directly display <tt>pgm</tt> and <tt>ppm</tt> files, including the
<tt>xv</tt> program which is installed on the SEAS Unix machines and the Aquamacs text editor on Mac OS X.
However, many image-viewing
applications require that the image first be converted to a JPEG.
This can be done with the <tt>ppmtojpeg</tt> program at the command
line as follows: <tt>ppmtojpeg input-file.ppm > output-file.jpg</tt>.
Despite the name of this program, it will work for both .ppm and .pgm
files.  This program comes with many Linux distributions as well as
with Cygwin for Windows; it is also installed on the SEAS Unix
machines.  If you don't already have it, you can download
<tt>ppmtojpeg</tt> as part of the Netpbm package.  See the "Pre-Built
Distributions" section of the <a
 href="http://netpbm.sourceforge.net/getting_netpbm.php">Netpbm home page</a> to install
it for your platform.  If you use a Mac and have MacPorts installed,
you can use the command <tt>sudo port install netpbm</tt></li><p>

<li>
<b>Generating Random Expressions:</b> Your next programming task is
to complete the definition of <tt>build</tt> at the top of <tt>art.ml</tt>, of
type <tt>int -> Expr1.t</tt>. The function should produce a random
expression representable as a value of type <tt>Expr1.t</tt>.
The integer parameter to <tt>build</tt>
is an upper bound on the nesting
depth that the resulting expression should have. A bound on the
nesting depth keeps the expression to a manageable size; it's easy to
write a naive expression generator that can generate incredibly
enormous expressions.  When you reach the cut-off point (i.e., <tt>depth</tt>
is 0), you can simply return (the representation of)
an expression with no sub-expressions,
such as <tt>x</tt> or <tt>y</tt>.
If you are not yet at the cut-off point,
randomly select one of the forms of <tt>Expr1.t</tt> and recursively generate its
subexpressions.  <b><i>Important</i>: You should only create expressions via the various <tt>Expr1.build*</tt> functions rather than by directly constructing
values of type <tt>Expr1.t</tt>; otherwise you will have to modify your <tt>build</tt> function later.</b>

<p> Use OCaml's <a href="http://caml.inria.fr/pub/docs/manual-ocaml/libref/Random.html"><tt>Random</tt> module</a> to get a source of
(pseudo)randomness to use in your implementation of <tt>build</tt>.  In
particular, the function <tt>Random.int</tt>, which returns a random
integer between 0 (inclusive) and some given upper bound (exclusive), should be useful.
(The function that calls <tt>build</tt> takes care of initializing the random number generator via <tt>Random.init</tt>, 
so you don't have to worry about that here.)


<p>A few notes:
<ul>
  <li>To get a better feel for things,
  start by manually building some different expressions and seeing what kind of pictures they produce, using <tt>emitGrayscale</tt> and <tt>emitColor</tt>.</li>
<li>
A depth of 8-12 for your random expressions is reasonable to
start, but experiment to see what you think is best.</li>
<li>You
need not choose each expression form with equal probability.  If every kind of
expression can occur with equal probability at any point, it is very
likely that the random expression you get will be 
something small, because <tt>X</tt> or <tt>Y</tt> will be chosen
and cut off the recursion.  Since small expressions
produce boring pictures, you should find some way to prevent or discourage
expressions with no subexpressions from being chosen too early.
There are many options for doing this; experiment and pick one
that gives you good results.</li></ul>

<p> You can test your
code by running the function <tt>doRandomGray</tt> of type
<tt>int * int -> unit</tt>,
which uses <tt>build</tt> to create
a random grayscale image.  The first integer argument is
the maximum nesting depth for the random expression to be generated.
The second integer argument is a <i>seed value</i>,
which this function uses to initialize the random number
generator.  These seeds can be arbitrary integers -- a given seed will produce
the same sequence of random numbers (and therefore the same random picture) every time it is used.
The invocation <tt>doRandomGray(d,s)</tt> emits the grayscale
image as a file
<tt>art-d-s.pgm</tt>.

<p>Similarly, the function <tt>doRandomColor</tt> of type
<tt>int * int -> unit</tt> creates a random color image.  
Given a maximum expression depth and a seed for the
random number generator, <tt>doRandomColor</tt>
creates three random functions which are used to produce random red, green,
and blue values, respectively, for each pixel.
The invocation <tt>doRandomColor(d,s)</tt> emits the color
image as a file
<tt>art-d-s.ppm</tt>.  Note the different file extension.</li>

<p>The <tt>doManyRandom</tt> function at the end of the <tt>Art</tt> module can be used to generate many images at once.  For example, <tt>doManyRandom (doRandomGray, 10, 50, 75)</tt> will invoke the <tt>doRandomGray</tt> function 26 times, each time with a depth of 10 and a seed value in the range 50-75 -- <tt>doRandomGray(10, 50), doRandomGray(10, 51), ..., doRandomGray(10, 75)</tt>.  You can similarly use this function with <tt>doRandomColor</tt>.  Note how the function is simply implemented using the <tt>forLoop</tt> you defined earlier.<p>

<li><b>Generalizing the Art module:</b>  Right now the <tt>Art</tt> module is hard-coded to use the implementation of expressions defined in <tt>Expr1</tt>.  We can make the <tt>Art</tt> module more reusable by turning it into a <i>functor</i>:  a module that (in this case) takes
as an explicit parameter a module implementing expressions.  That way we can easily "plug in" different implementations of expressions (which we will exploit below).

<p>First complete the implementation of the <tt>EXPR</tt> signature (module type) in file <tt>expr.ml</tt>, which represents
the type for a module that implements the expression type <tt>t</tt> and associated operations required by the <tt>Art</tt> module.
Specifically, the signature
should include type declarations for all the types and operations from <tt>Expr1</tt> that your <tt>Art</tt> module depends upon.
Then modify the <tt>Art</tt> module to instead be a functor expecting a parameter of type <tt>EXPR</tt>.
<i>When you're done, there should be no references to <tt>Expr1</tt> in the <tt>Art</tt> functor.</i>  The <tt>Art</tt> functor can now be <i>instantiated</i> on <tt>Expr1</tt> in the OCaml interpreter to produce a module equivalent to your earlier hard-coded one, as follows:  <tt>module Art1 = Art(Expr1);;</tt>.  <i>You should not need to modify <tt>expr1.ml</tt> at all for this problem.</i>
<b><i>Important</i>:The declaration of type <tt>t</tt> should be kept abstract in the definition of <tt>EXPR</tt>.
This ensures
that the <tt>Art</tt> module does not depend on internal implementation details of expressions and allows us to easily plug in completely different implementations (see the next problem).</b>

<li><b>An Alternate Representation:</b> Rather than using a datatype
to represent an expression, it might be more natural (and more
efficient) to use a function.  After all, a value of type <tt>EXPR.t</tt> really
represents a function that takes an x-y coordinate (i.e., a pair of floats)
and returns a pixel value (also a float).
Since the signature <tt>EXPR</tt> hides the representation of the type
<tt>t</tt>, we are free to change that representation
without affecting clients like the <tt>Art</tt> module.
Accordingly,
the file <tt>expr2.ml</tt> provides the
<tt>Expr2</tt> structure, in which the type
<tt>t</tt> is just another name for the type <tt>float * float
-> float</tt>.

<p>Complete <tt>expr2.ml</tt> by defining the missing functions that are required in order for <tt>Expr2</tt> to meet the
<tt>EXPR</tt> signature, specifically the various <tt>build*</tt> functions as well as the <tt>eval</tt> function.
The
<tt>exprToString</tt> function cannot be written
successfully, since there is no easy way to convert an OCaml function to a
string. Thus, you can leave that as is; it currently returns the
string <tt>"unknown"</tt>.

<p>
To test your code, add
<tt>#use "expr2.ml";;</tt> to the end of the file <tt>hw3.ml</tt>.
Now you can create an instantiation of <tt>Art</tt> with your new module for expressions:
<tt>module Art2 = Art(Expr2);;</tt>.  This module should have the same visible behavior as <tt>Art1</tt> above.
Notice the power of the separation of interface
from implementation.
We completely changed the representation of expressions and
the associated functions.  However, since the new module still meets
the <tt>EXPR</tt> signature, the <tt>Art</tt> structure can remain completely
unchanged, and the implementer of that module need not even be aware of the
change.
