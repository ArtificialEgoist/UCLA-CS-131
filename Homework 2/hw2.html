<h1>Homework 2</h1>

<h2>Due Tuesday, April 16, at 11:30pm</h2>
<h3>Turn in your homework via the course web page as an updated version of the <tt>hw2.ml</tt>
text file that I have provided. 

<h3>Make sure the file can be successfully loaded into the OCaml interpreter
via the <tt>#use</tt> directive; if not you get an automatic 0 for the homework!</h3>

<h3>Recall the CS131 Academic Honesty Policy!  You must list whom you
discussed the assignment with at the top of your assignment, and also what
other resources you used.</h3>

For this assignment, you will get practice using datatypes as well as higher-order functions in ML.
In a few places below, you are required to use one of the higher-order functions from the
<a href="http://caml.inria.fr/pub/docs/manual-ocaml/libref/List.html">List module</a> that we saw in class
(e.g., <tt>List.map</tt> and <tt>List.fold_right</tt>), so <i>pay attention to those directives or you will get no credit for the problem</i>.
In addition you should obey our usual style rules:

<ul> <li> <i>Never</i> use imperative features like
assignment and loops.  If you're using a construct not discussed in
class or in the book, you're probably doing something bad!</li> <li>
Use pattern matching instead of conditionals wherever it is possible
to do so.</li> <li> Use local variables to avoid recomputing an
expression that is needed multiple times in a function.</li>
<li>Similarly, avoid code duplication.  If the same code is needed in
multiple places, possibly with slight variations, make a helper function
so that the code only has to be written once.</li>
</ul>

A few other tips: <ul>
<li>Create any number of helper functions as needed.
 It may be
advantageous to make these functions local to the main function being
defined, so they
can refer to names bound in the enclosing function.  Try to find
opportunities to make use of this feature.
</li>
<li> Write comments where useful to tell the
reader what's going on.  Comments in OCaml are enclosed in <tt>(*</tt>
and <tt>*)</tt>.  The grader should be able to easily understand what
your code is doing.  One useful comment is to provide the type of any
helper function that you define.</li>

<li> Test your functions on several inputs, including corner cases --
we will be doing the same.</li>
</ul>

Now on to the assignment!
I've provided a file <tt>hw2.ml</tt> that has a comment giving the name and type of each function that you must implement.  <b>Make sure each of your functions has exactly the expected name and type; otherwise you will get no credit for it.</b>  I've also declared some datatypes that are useful in certain problems.

<h3>Problem #1: Warm-Up</h3>

<ol type="a"> <li>In class we saw how to implement two common higher-order functions on lists,
  <tt>map</tt> and <tt>fold_right</tt>.
For this problem, implement <tt>fold_left</tt>.
  <i>Do not use any functions from the <tt>List</tt> module or other modules.</i></li>

<p><li>On the last homework assignment you implemented a <tt>flatten</tt> function on lists of lists.  Implement it again, but now <i>the entire implementation should be a single call to a higher-order function from the <tt>List</tt> module that we saw in class</i>.</li>

<p><li>Implement a function <tt>pipe</tt>, which acts similar to the Unix pipe operator: it takes a list of functions 
<tt>[f1;...;fn]</tt> and returns a function <tt>f</tt>
such that for any <tt>x</tt>, the invocation <tt>f x</tt> is equivalent to
<tt>fn(...(f2(f1 x)))</tt>.
<i>The entire implementation should be a single call to a higher-order function from the <tt>List</tt> module that we saw in class.</i>
Some examples:
</p>
<blockquote>
  <p><tt>
    # pipe [] 3;;</font><br>
    - :  int =  3 <br>
    # pipe [(fun x-&gt; 2*x);(fun x -&gt; x + 3)] 3 ;;</font><br>
    - :  int =  9 <br>
    # pipe [(fun x -&gt; x + 3);(fun x-&gt; 2*x)] 3;;</font><br>
    - :  int =  12<br>
 </tt></p>
</blockquote></li>

<p><li> In class we saw the advantages of currying.  For example, a
function of type <tt>int -> string -> bool</tt> conceptually takes two
arguments, but because they are curried it is possible to pass just an
integer and get back a function of type <tt>string -> bool</tt>.
However, it is not possible to pass in a string and get back a
function of type <tt>int -> bool</tt> because the string is the "second" argument.

<p>Fortunately there is an easy fix.  Define a function <tt>swap</tt>
of type <tt>('a -> 'b -> 'c) -> ('b -> 'a -> 'c)</tt> that swaps the order of two arguments to a curried function.
For example, suppose <tt>f</tt> has type <tt>int -> string ->
bool</tt>, and let <tt>g</tt> be <tt>swap f</tt>.  Then <tt>g "hello"</tt> returns a function of type
<tt>int -> bool</tt>, and more generally, <tt>g x y</tt> has the same behavior as <tt>f y x</tt>.</li>
</ol>

<h3>Problem #2: Dictionaries</h3>

A <i>dictionary</i> (sometimes also called a <i>map</i>) is a mapping from keys to values, supporting two main operations:  <tt>put</tt>, which adds a new key-value pair to the dictionary, and <tt>get</tt>, which looks up the value associated with a given key in the dictionary.  If the given key is already mapped to some value in the dictionary, then <tt>put</tt> should (conceptually)
replace the old key-value pair with the new one.

<p>In this problem we'll explore three different implementations of a dictionary data structure.

<ol type="a">
 <li> Our first implementation of a dictionary is as an <i>association list</i>, i.e. a list of pairs.  We actually saw this briefly in class and we implemented the <tt>get</tt> function (but called it <tt>lookup</tt>).  Implement <tt>put1</tt> and <tt>get1</tt> for association lists (we use the suffix <tt>1</tt> to distinguish from other implementations below).
  To get the effect of replacing old entries for a key, 
  <tt>put1</tt> should simply add new entries to the front of the list, and accordingly <tt>get1</tt> should
  return the leftmost value whose associated key matches the given key.
<i>The entire implementation of <tt>get1</tt>
  should be a single call to a higher-order function from the <tt>List</tt> module that we saw in class.</i></li>

<p><li> A different way to implement a dictionary is by declaring a new datatype:  

<blockquote>
  <p><tt>type dict2 = Empty | Entry of string * int * dict2
 </tt></p>
</blockquote>

For example, the dictionary that maps <tt>"hello"</tt> to <tt>5</tt> and has no other entries would be represented as the value <tt>Entry("hello", 5, Empty)</tt>.
For simplicity we have hard-coded the type of keys to be <tt>string</tt> and the type of values to be <tt>int</tt>, but we could have instead declared <tt>dict2</tt>
to be <i>polymorphic</i> over the key and value types.

<p>Implement <tt>put2</tt> and <tt>get2</tt> for <tt>dict2</tt>.  As above, new entries should be added to the front of the dictionary, and <tt>get2</tt> should return the leftmost match.</li>

<p><li> Yet another way to represent a dictionary is as a function from keys to values.  We can declare a new datatype that uses this alternate representation (again specialized for simplicity to the case when keys are strings and values are integers):

<blockquote>
  <p><tt>type dict3 = Dict3 of (string -> int option)
 </tt></p>
</blockquote>

In this representation, a key that the underlying function maps to <tt>None</tt> is considered to not be in the dictionary, and a key that the underlying function maps to <tt>Some v</tt> is considered to have associated value <tt>v</tt>.  For instance, this dictionary maps <tt>"hello"</tt> to
<tt>5</tt> and has no other entries:

<blockquote>
  <p><tt>Dict3 (function s -> match s with "hello" -> Some 5 | _ -> None)
 </tt></p>
</blockquote>


One advantage of this representation over the two dictionary implementations above is that we can
represent infinite-size dictionaries.  For instance, the following dictionary maps all strings
to their length (using the <tt>String.length</tt> function):

<blockquote>
  <p><tt>Dict3 (function s -> Some (String.length s))
 </tt></p>
</blockquote>

Implement <tt>put3</tt> and <tt>get3</tt> for <tt>dict3</tt>.</li>

</ol>

<h3>Problem #3: Calculators</h3>

<ol type="a">
<p> <li> Consider a simple calculator that accepts arithmetic expressions and computes their values.  An implementation of the calculator might
  <i>parse</i> the user input into a nice tree structure like the following:

<p><tt>type op = Plus | Minus | Times | Divide</tt><br>
<tt>type aexp = Num of float | BinOp of aexp * op * aexp</tt>

<p> For example, the expression <tt>(1.0 + 2.0) * 3.0</tt> would be
parsed into the 
value <tt>BinOp(BinOp(Num 1.0, Plus, Num 2.0), Times, Num 3.0)</tt>.

<p>Write a function <tt>evalAExp</tt> of type <tt>aexp -> float</tt>
that evaluates a given arithmetic expression.  For example, the result of evaluating our expression above should be <tt>9.0</tt> (which OCaml prints as just <tt>9.</tt> without the trailing zero).  You do not need to handle division-by-zero errors.
</li>

<p><li> Some HP calculators (as well as the <tt>dc</tt> calculator at the terminal in Linux and Mac OS X)
and some programming languages (e.g., the language of the Java virtual machine, which Java programs compile to) evaluate expressions using a stack.  An arithmetic computation is expressed as a sequence
(i.e., a list) of stack operations, each of which is represented as a value of the following datatype:

<p><tt>type sopn = Push of float | Swap | Calculate of op</tt>

<p>The operations are defined to manipulate a stack of floating point
numbers (which we'll represent as a <tt>float list</tt>).  The
operation <tt>Push n</tt> pushes the number <tt>n</tt> onto the stack
(thereby increasing the stack size by 1).  The operation <tt>Swap</tt> pops the top two numbers off the stack and pushes them back
on the stack in reverse order (thereby keeping the stack the same size).  The operation <tt>Calculate
op</tt> pops the top two numbers <tt>n1</tt> and <tt>n2</tt> off the stack and pushes the result
of evaluating <tt>(n2 op n1)</tt> onto the stack (thereby decreasing the stack size by 1).  <i>Note that the first operand in the computation is the second value popped off the stack, and the second operand is the first value popped off the stack.  This makes a difference for non-commutative operations like subtraction and division.  This behavior makes sense since it corresponds with the order in which the operands were originally computed (and pushed onto the stack).</i>

<p>For example, the arithmetic expression <tt>(1.0 + 2.0) * 3.0</tt>
can be represented by the sequence of stack operations <tt>[Push 1.0;
Push 2.0; Calculate Plus; Push 3.0; Calculate Times]</tt>.  This style
of inputting the two operands before the operator is known as Reverse Polish notation (RPN).

<p>Write a function <tt>evalRPN</tt> of type <tt>sopn list -> float</tt> that evaluates a sequence of stack operations.
For example, <tt>evalRPN([Push 1.0; Push 2.0; Calculate Plus; Push 3.0; Calculate Times])</tt> should evaluate to <tt>9.0</tt>.  You will
find it useful to do most of the work in a helper function of type <tt>sopn list -> float list -> float</tt>, where the additional <tt>float list</tt> argument is used as a stack. 
Once all of the stack operations have been processed, the number at the top of the stack will be the
final result value to return.
Don't worry about the possibility of
stack underflow, which occurs when the stack has too few elements to perform the next operation. (But note how the ML typechecker properly warns about this possibility!)
</li>

<p>
<li>
Write a function <tt>toRPN</tt> of type <tt>aexp -> sopn list</tt> that converts
an arithmetic expression into a sequence of stack operations which represents the same computation.
There should be a <tt>Calculate Plus</tt> stack operation
for every <tt>Plus</tt> in the input, and so on; evaluating the input expression to a
number <tt>n</tt> and then returning <tt>[Push n]</tt> will get you no credit.
You should not need to ever use the <tt>Swap</tt> operation.
<i>Hint: This function corresponds exactly to a postorder traversal of the input expression
when viewed as a tree.</i>
</li>

<p><li>Write a function <tt>fromRPN</tt> of type
  <tt>sopn list -> aexp</tt> that converts a list of stack operations
  into an arithmetic expression that represents the same computation.  Again, simply evaluating the input expression to a number will get you no credit.  You may assume that the
  given sequence of stack commands does in fact correspond to a single
  arithmetic expression.  <i>Hint: This function is not too different from <tt>evalRPN</tt> above.  Like that one, here you will also want
to define a helper function that uses a stack, but instead of the stack holding numbers, now it will hold values of type <tt>aexp</tt>.</i>
