<h1>Homework 7</h1>

<h2>Due Thursday, June 6, at 11:30pm</h2>

<h3>Turn in your homework as a single Prolog file called
<tt>hw7.pl</tt> &mdash; please use <i>exactly</i> that name &mdash; via the course web page.</h3>

<h3>Recall the CS131 Academic Honesty Policy!  You must say who you
discussed the assignment with at the top of your assignment, and also what
other resources you used.</h3>

<p>Some rules and advice:
<ul>
  <li>You may define any number of helper predicates as needed to solve
the following problems.</li>
<li>You may use predicates from the GNU Prolog library (see the
<a href="http://www.gprolog.org/manual/gprolog.html">GNU Prolog Manual</a>) except where
explicitly disallowed.
<li>Your code
should never go into an infinite loop except where explicitly allowed.</li>
<li>Except where explicitly indicated, your code
need not produce solutions in a particular order, as long as it produces all and only correct solutions and
produces each solution the right number of times.
</li>
<li>Some of these problems are computationally hard (e.g., NP-complete).  For such problems especially,
the order in which you put subgoals in a rule can make a <i>big</i> difference on running time.  In general
the best strategy is to put the <i>strongest</i> constraints earliest, i.e., the constraints that will
prune the search space the most.
</li>
</ul>


To test your code, make a text file that has a bunch of queries that you want to input at the interpreter. You can use the <tt>=</tt> predicate
to ensure that the queries have the expected results.  For example, the file could have the following form:

<pre>
consult(hw7).
dupList([1,2,3], Y), Y = [1,1,2,2,3,3].
... a bunch of other queries to use as tests
</pre>

If this file is called hw7Test, then you can do "gprolog < hw7Test" to run all the tests.
For queries that have multiple answers, it will be helpful to use the <tt>findall</tt> or <tt>setof</tt> predicates in your tests.

<p>
Now on to the assignment!  <b>Make sure your predicates have the exact same names and order of arguments as described below.</b>

<ol> <li>Implement a predicate <tt>duplist(X,Y)</tt> which succeeds whenever
  list <tt>Y</tt> is simply list <tt>X</tt> with each element duplicated.
  For example:

<pre>
| ?- duplist([1,2,3], Y).

Y = [1,1,2,2,3,3]
</pre>

Make sure that your predicate works in both directions.  For example, you should
be able to ask the query <tt>duplist(X, [1,1,2,2,3,3])</tt> and get the right
value of <tt>X</tt>.<p></li>

<li>Implement a predicate <tt>oddsize(L)</tt> which succeeds if <tt>L</tt> is a list whose length is an odd number.  <i>Your code should not compute the actual length of the list or do any arithmetic.</i><p></li>

<li>
Implement a predicate <tt>subsetsum(L,Sum,Subset)</tt> that takes a list <tt>L</tt> of numbers and a number <tt>Sum</tt> and produces as instantiations of
<tt>Subset</tt> all subsequences of <tt>L</tt> whose sum is exactly <tt>Sum</tt>.   A list
<tt>l1</tt> is a <i>subsequence</i> of a list <tt>l2</tt> if
<tt>l1</tt> can be obtained by removing zero or more elements from
anywhere within
<tt>l2</tt>.  Note that this means that the elements in <tt>l1</tt>
have to be in the same order as they are in <tt>l2</tt>.  For example,
<tt>[1,3]</tt> is a subsequence of <tt>[1,2,3]</tt>, but
<tt>[3,1]</tt> is not.

<p>For example:

<pre>
| ?- subsetsum([1,2,5,3,2],5,Subset). 

Subset = [1,2,2] ? ;

Subset = [2,3] ? ;

Subset = [5] ? ;

Subset = [3,2] ? ;
</pre>

You may assume that <tt>L</tt> and <tt>Sum</tt> are always variable-free.
<b>You may not use the built-in predicates
<tt>sublist</tt> and <tt>sum_list</tt></b>.  If you define similar predicates, give them different names so they don't clash with the built-in ones.<p></li>

<li>In this problem, you will write a Prolog program to solve a form
of the <i>blocks world</i> problem, which is a famous problem from
artificial intelligence.  Imagine you have three stacks of blocks in a
particular configuration, and the goal is to move blocks around so
that the three stacks end up in some other configuration.
You have a robot that knows how to
do two kinds of actions.  First, the robot
can pick up the top block from a stack,
as long as that stack is nonempty and the robot's mechanical hand is
free.  Second, the robot can place a block from its hand on to a
stack.

<p> Implement a Prolog relation <tt>blocksworld</tt> that has three
arguments:  a start world, a goal world, and a list of
actions that take the world from the start world to the goal
world.

<p>We will represent a world as a relation
<tt>world</tt> that has four components:  three lists to represent
the three stacks, and a component to represent the contents of the
mechanical hand.  That last component either contains a single block
or the constant <tt>none</tt>, to represent the fact that the hand is
empty.  Your implementation should not care what the blocks actually
look like; the users can provide any constants they wish to stand for
blocks.  For example, 
<tt>world([a,b,c],[],[d],none)</tt> represents a world in
which there are four blocks, with three of them in the first stack
(in the specified order, with <tt>a</tt> at the top of the stack), the
fourth block on the third stack, and nothing in the mechanical hand.

<p>We will use the constants <tt>stack1</tt>, <tt>stack2</tt>, and <tt>stack3</tt>
to represent the three stacks.  There are two kinds of actions,
<tt>pickup(s)</tt> and <tt>putdown(s)</tt>, corresponding to the two
robot actions described above, where <tt>s</tt> is one of the three
stack constants.

<p>For example, here is a sample query:
<pre>
| ?- length(Actions,10), blocksworld(world([a,b,c],[],[],none),world([],[],[a,b,c],none), Actions).

Actions = [pickup(stack1),putdown(stack2),pickup(stack1),putdown(stack2),pickup(stack1),putdown(stack3),pickup(stack2),putdown(stack3),pickup(stack2),putdown(stack3)] ?
</pre>

<p>Notice how I use <tt>length</tt> to limit the size of the resulting
list of actions.  This is necessary to do when you test your code, in
order to prevent Prolog from getting stuck
down infinite paths (e.g., continually picking up and putting down the
same block).
<p></li>

<li>In Homework 4 you implemented a typechecker for a subset of OCaml.  With Prolog it's just as easy to implement <i>type inference</i>.  The idea is for you to just express constraints on the type of each subexpression in a program (e.g., for an expression of the form e1+e2, both e1 and e2, as well as the entire expression, must have type int), and then Prolog will automatically solve these constraints, in the process inferring
the types of variables based on how they are used within other expressions (e.g., if e1 in our earlier example is the variable x, then we have inferred that x must have type int).

<p>Implement a predicate <tt>typeInfer(E,Env,T)</tt> which succeeds when the expression <tt>E</tt> has type <tt>T</tt> under type environment <tt>Env</tt>.  To represent expressions we will use parse trees defined by the following grammar:

<pre>
E ::= intconst(I) | boolconst(B) | plus(E1, E2) | var(X) | if(E1, E2, E3) | function(X, E) | funCall(E1, E2)
</pre>

where <tt>I</tt> ranges over integer constants, <tt>B</tt> ranges over the atoms <tt>true</tt> and <tt>false</tt>, and <tt>X</tt> ranges over all other atoms, which we'll use as variable names.
For example, the OCaml program <tt>(function x -> x+1) 34</tt> would be represented by the term <tt>funCall(function(x, plus(var(x), intconst(1))), intconst(34))</tt>.  For simplicity, you can assume that each variable declared in a program has a unique name.

As usual we'll represent a type environment as a list of pairs of a variable name and a type, but since Prolog doesn't have tuples, the pairs will themselves simply be lists of size two.  Finally, the syntax of
types will be defined by the following grammar:

<pre>
T ::= int | bool | arrow(T1, T2)
</pre>
</li> 

Here are some examples of what your predicate should be able to do:

<pre>
| ?- typeInfer(function(x, plus(var(x), intconst(1))), [], T).

T = arrow(int,int) ?

| ?- typeInfer(funCall(function(x, plus(var(x), intconst(1))), intconst(34)), [], T).

T = int ?

| ?- typeInfer(if(var(x),var(y),intconst(34)), [[x,T1],[y,T2]], T).

T = int
T1 = bool
T2 = int ?

| ?- typeInfer(function(x, var(x)), [], T).

T = arrow(A,A) ?
</pre>
